Foodalternative

This MERN stack web application is designed to help users discover nearby restaurants and share recipes. Built with React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, it leverages google-map-react for interactive map functionality and MaterialUI for a modern, responsive design. State management is handled through Redux and Redux-Saga to ensure smooth and efficient data flow. The application is intended as a personal project to refresh MERN stack knowledge and provide a practical tool for finding restaurants.
